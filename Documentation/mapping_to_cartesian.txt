Documentation for Mapping a Floor Plan to a Cartesian Plane

Getting set up:

Download a floor plan and convert it from a pdf file to a png file.
Import into desmos to impose it on the graphing structure. 
Expand the map so that the top and bottom edges are at 50 and -50, respectively, on the plane.
Move the image so that the bottom left corner of the floor plan is on the origin.

Mapping:

Create lines in hallways (such has y = 5, x = 20, etc.). 
Add points onto the lines representing the hallways next to doors.
Feel free to add more lines as necessary for rooms that might be hidden behind other rooms.
download the graph/plan with the lines and points, and make sure to record the lines and points with their room numbers.
